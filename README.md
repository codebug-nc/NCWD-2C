### Let's practice some terminal commands to get the code on our computers
* Let's pull down this code so we can work on the lesson. Click the green button on this page, and let's copy to our clipboard the URL for this code base. Make sure you are on the desktop, if not, `cd` to the Desktop.
* Do you know the rest of the steps? Here they are below: 
```
git clone <url>
cd NCWD-2A
git checkout -b <name>
subl .
open index.html
```
* DO NOT change any code in `index.html`
* Fix the code in `style.css` so that it is working properly
  * HINT: the code in `style.css` is mostly correct, but we are accessing the ids and classes incorrectly
* After fixing your cheeseburger, please answer the questions at the bottom of style.css


##### If you finish early...
* Change the color of the text to yellow
* Add more HTML and style it in the CSS to add more toppings to your cheeseburger. Here's a cheeseburger with lettuce and tomato:
