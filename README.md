### Let's practice some terminal commands to get the code on our computers
* Let's pull down this code so we can work on the lesson. Click the green button on this page, and let's copy to our clipboard the URL for this code base.
* From the terminal, run `git clone URL_GOES_HERE` with the URL we've copied to our clipboard. 
* Now, use the `cd` command to change our current directory to the code base we just pulled down.
* DO NOT change any code in `index.html`
* Fix the code in `style.css` so that it is working properly
  * HINT: the code in `style.css` is mostly correct, but we are accessing the ids and classes incorrectly
* After fixing your cheeseburger, please answer the questions at the bottom of style.css


##### If you finish early...
* Change the color of the text to yellow
* Add more HTML and style it in the CSS to add more toppings to your cheeseburger. Here's a cheeseburger with lettuce and tomato:
